Built-in connections between these services are still emerging, but end-user-programming tools such as If-This-Then-That (IFTTT) have existed for almost a decade, allowing users to create rules (called applets in IFTTT) that dictate interactions between devices and services. Previous work found potential secrecy or integrity violations in many applets, but did so without examining how individual users interact with the service. In this work, we study the risks of real-world use of IFTTT by collecting and analyzing 732 applets installed by 28 participants and participants' responses to several survey questions. We found that significantly fewer applets than previously thought pose realistic secrecy or integrity risks to the users who install them. Perhaps consistently, participants were generally not concerned about potential harms, even when these were explained to them. However, examining participants' applets led us to identify several new types of privacy risks, which challenge some assumptions inherent in previous analyses that focus on secrecy and integrity risks. For example, we found that many applets involve monitoring incidental users: family, friends, and neighbors who may interact with someone else's smart-home devices, possibly without realizing it.

In this interactive demo, we present *Fraud Bingo*, an intervention designed by WISE \u0026 Healthy Aging Center in Southern California prior to 2012, that has been played by older adults throughout the United States. We also present the Scam Defender Obstacle Course (SDOC), an interactive web application that tests a user's ability to identify scams, and subsequently explains how to recognize the scams. SDOC is patterned after existing phishing-recognition training tools for working professionals. We present the results of running a workshop with 17 senior citizens, where we performed a controlled study that used SDOC to measure the effectiveness of Fraud Bingo. We outline the difficulties several participants had with completing SDOC, which indicate that tools like SDOC should be tailored to the needs of older adults.

Unlike previous attacks on such DNNs, ours manipulates instructions that are a functional part of the binary, which makes it particularly challenging to defend against. We evaluated our attack against three DNNs in white-box and black-box settings, and found that it can often achieve success rates near 100%. Moreover, we found that our attack can fool some commercial anti-viruses, in certain cases with a success rate of 85%. We explored several defenses, both new and old, and identified some that can successfully prevent over 80% of our evasion attempts. However, these defenses may still be susceptible to evasion by adaptive attackers, and so we advocate for augmenting malware-detection systems with methods that do not rely on machine learning.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Optimization-Guided Binary Diversification to Mislead Neural Networks for Malware Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahmood Sharif"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573430400,"objectID":"fd6914ecac593b5f2aae97f750b58292","permalink":"/publication/thesis19-phd-cmu-ece/","publishdate":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis19-phd-cmu-ece/","section":"publication","summary":"Prior work has shown that machine-learning algorithms are vulnerable to evasion by so-called adversarial examples. Nonetheless, the majority of the work on evasion attacks has mainly explored $L_p$-bounded perturbations that lead to misclassification. From a computer-security perspective, such attacks have limited practical implications. To fill the gap, we propose evasion attacks that satisfy *multiple objectives*, and show that these attacks pose a practical threat to computer systems. In particular, we demonstrate how to produce adversarial examples against state-of-the-art face-recognition and malware-detection systems that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives (e.g., smoothness and robustness against changes in imaging conditions) to mislead the systems in practical settings. Against face recognition, we develop a systematic method to automatically generate attacks, which are realized through printing a pair of eyeglass frames. When worn by attackers, the eyeglasses allow them mislead face-recognition algorithms to evade recognition or impersonate other individuals. Against malware detection, we develop an attack that guides binary-diversification tools via optimization to transform binaries in a functionality preserving manner and mislead detection.\nThe attacks that we initially demonstrate achieve the desired objectives via ad hoc optimizations. We extend these attacks via a general framework to train a generator neural network to emit adversarial examples satisfying desired objectives. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to accommodate a wide range of objectives, including imprecise ones difficult to model, in two application domains. Specifically, we demonstrate how to produce adversarial eyeglass frames to mislead face recognition with better robustness, inconspicuousness, and scalability than previous approaches, as well as a new attack to fool a handwritten-digit classifier.\nFinally, to protect computer-systems from adversarial examples, we propose $n$-ML---a novel defense that is inspired by $n$-version programming. $n$-ML trains an ensemble of $n$ classifiers, and classifies inputs by a vote. Unlike prior approaches, however, the classifiers are trained to classify adversarial examples differently than each other, rendering it very difficult for an adversarial example to obtain enough votes to be misclassified. In several application domains (including face and street-sign recognition), we show that $n$-ML roughly retains the benign classification accuracies of state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously defending against adversarial examples (produced by our framework, or $L_p$-based attacks) with better resilience than the best defenses known to date and, in most cases, with lower inference-time overhead.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Practical Inference-Time Attacks Against Machine-Learning Systems and a Defense Against Them","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahmood Sharif","Sruti Bhagavatula","Lujo Bauer","Michael K.

We examined the effects of realism and purpose of use on users' valuations of their personal information. Specifically, we conducted an online study in which participants (N=434) were asked to assign monetary value to their personal information in the context of an information marketplace involving different receiving parties, while we experimentally manipulated the level of realism of the scenario and the timing of eliciting valuations. Among our findings is a nuanced understanding of valuation biases, including when they may not apply. For example, we find that, contrary to common belief, participants' valuations are not generally higher in hypothetical scenarios compared to realistic ones. Importantly, we find that while absolute valuations vary greatly between participants, the order in which users prioritize information types (i.e., users' relative valuations of different attributes) remains stable across the levels of realism we study.

By observing user behavior, it can predict whether they will be exposed to malicious content on the web seconds before the moment of exposure, thus opening a window of opportunity for proactive defenses. We evaluate our system using three months' worth of HTTP traffic generated by 20,645 users of a large cellular provider in 2017 and show that it can be helpful, even when only very low false positive rates are acceptable, and despite the difficulty of making \"on-the-fly\" predictions. We also engage directly with the users through surveys asking them demographic and security-related questions, to evaluate the utility of self-reported data for predicting exposure to malicious content. We find that self-reported data can help forecast exposure risk over long periods of time.

Both algorithms that create adversarial examples and strategies for defending against adversarial examples typically use $L_p$-norms to measure the perceptual similarity between an adversarial input and its benign original. Prior work has already shown, however, that two images need not be close to each other as measured by an $L_p$-norm to be perceptually similar. In this work, we show that nearness according to an $L_p$-norm is not just unnecessary for perceptual similarity, but is also insufficient. Specifically, focusing on datasets (CIFAR10 and MNIST), $L_p$-norms, and thresholds used in prior work, we show through online user studies that \"adversarial examples\" that are closer to their benign counterparts than required by commonly used $L_p$-norm thresholds can nevertheless be perceptually distinct to humans from the corresponding benign examples. Namely, the perceptual distance between two images that are \"near\" each other according to an $L_p$-norm can be high enough that participants frequently classify the two images as representing different objects or digits. Combined with prior work, we thus demonstrate that nearness of inputs as measured by $L_p$-norms is neither necessary nor sufficient for perceptual similarity, which has implications for both creating and defending against adversarial examples. We propose and discuss alternative similarity metrics to stimulate future research in the area.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"On the Suitability of $L_p$-norms for Creating and Preventing Adversarial Examples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Melicher","Anupam Das","Mahmood Sharif","Lujo Bauer","Limin Jia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"6f4c6c4af654abbafd6e00dd9246192e","permalink":"/publication/ndss18-dom-xss/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ndss18-dom-xss/","section":"publication","summary":"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are the most frequently reported web application vulnerability.

As the first contribution of this work, we empirically assess the impact of DOM XSS on the web using a browser with taint tracking embedded in the JavaScript engine. Building on the methodology used in a previous study that crawled popular websites, we collect a current dataset of potential DOM XSS vulnerabilities. We improve on the methodology for confirming XSS vulnerabilities, and using this improved methodology, we find 83% more vulnerabilities than previous methodology applied to the same dataset. As a second contribution, we identify the causes of and discuss how to prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities. One example of our findings is that custom HTML templating designs---a design pattern that could prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities analogous to parameterized SQL---can be buggy in practice, allowing DOM XSS attacks. As our third contribution, we evaluate the error rates of three static-analysis tools to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities found with dynamic analysis techniques using in-the-wild examples. We find static-analysis tools to miss 90% of bugs found by our dynamic analysis, though some tools can have very few false positives and at the same time find vulnerabilities not found using the dynamic analysis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Riding Out DOMsday: Toward Detecting and Preventing DOM Cross-Site Scripting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zachary Weinberg","Mahmood Sharif","Janos Szurdi","Nicolas Christin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"96a504ca4004253cb7a86caef5af9614","permalink":"/publication/pets17-censorship/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pets17-censorship/","section":"publication","summary":"Studies of Internet censorship rely on an experimental technique called probing. From a client within each country under investigation, the experimenter attempts to access network resources that are suspected to be censored, and records what happens.

We analyze the content and longevity of 758,191 webpages drawn from 22 different probe lists, of which 15 are alleged to be actual blacklists of censored webpages in particular countries, three were compiled using *a priori* criteria for selecting pages with an elevated chance of being censored, and four are controls. We find that the lists have very little overlap in terms of specific pages. Mechanically assigning a topic to each page, however, reveals common themes, and suggests that hand-curated probe lists may be neglecting certain frequently-censored topics. We also find that pages on controversial topics tend to have much shorter lifetimes than pages on uncontroversial topics. Hence, probe lists need to be continuously updated to be useful. To carry out this analysis, we have developed automated infrastructure for collecting snapshots of webpages, weeding out irrelevant material (e.g. site \"boilerplate\" and parked domains), translating text, assigning topics, and detecting topic changes.
